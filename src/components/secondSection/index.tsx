                    As the famous American author, salesman and motivational speaker Zig Ziglar once said: â€œHa ha hu ha hu". Success is the doing, not the getting; in the trying, not the triumph. Success is a personal standard, reaching for the highest that is in us, becoming all that we can be. If we do our best, we are a success.
